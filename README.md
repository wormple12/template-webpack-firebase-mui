# Template Project
This is a ready-to-use template project for personal projects.

The current tech stack includes:
- Webpack, Babel and TypeScript
- ReactJS
    - using Suspense API
    - w. Recoil as state management
- SCSS as preprocessor CSS
- Firebase as database and hosting
- Cypress as testing framework
- Lottie for animated SVGs

### Template Development Pipeline

- Material UI

- CSS Modules

- Transfer example features to another repo
    - for libraries like recoil, firestore, fetch, lottie: replace their actual usage in this project with simple links to examples in the other repo.

- Check the data fetching library Relay out. It should work well with the new Suspense API.
    - Relay requires GraphQL backend... see https://medium.com/@lukepighetti/yes-you-can-query-firebase-with-graphql-e79a45990f22
    - Instead check out React Query.
