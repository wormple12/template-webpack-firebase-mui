The current tech stack includes:

    - w. Recoil as state management
- SCSS as preprocessor CSS
- Firebase as database and hosting
- Cypress as testing framework
- Lottie for animated SVGs

### Template Development Pipeline

- Find optimal method to split into several versions of web design; (1) PC/Tablet and (2) Mobile.
    - Material UI?

- Check the data fetching library Relay out. It should work well with the new Suspense API.
    - Relay requires GraphQL backend... see https://medium.com/@lukepighetti/yes-you-can-query-firebase-with-graphql-e79a45990f22
    - Instead check out React Query.
