### Template Development Pipeline

- Integrate with Firestore (primarily with the purpose of testing if it works)

- Find optimal method to split into several versions of web design; (1) PC/Tablet and (2) Mobile.
    - Material UI?

- Check the data fetching library Relay out. It should work well with the new Suspense API.
    - Relay requires GraphQL backend... see https://medium.com/@lukepighetti/yes-you-can-query-firebase-with-graphql-e79a45990f22
    - Instead check out React Query.
    - Fetch from Star Wars API in Section 2. Make sure to use Suspense.

- Auth functionality with Firebase?

- Finishing touches: Make basic design as simple, structured and responsible as possible.
