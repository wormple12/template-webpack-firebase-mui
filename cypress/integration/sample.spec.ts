/*
Jest doesn't properly support ECMAScript Modules import/export yet (I tried
following their directions, but couldn't make it work), so I will either have to
wait or find another testing framework.

So far the plan was to implement Puppeteer with Jest, as seen in the following
Academind video:

But I don't know if Puppeteer works without Jest. More research needed.

2nd attempt to test using Cypress.
Seems to work, but requires all tests to be organized within the
cypress/integration folder, which is not optimal.

Uses Mocha and Chai Assertion, documentation here:

Remember the following blog post for organizing React data hooks for E2E testing:
